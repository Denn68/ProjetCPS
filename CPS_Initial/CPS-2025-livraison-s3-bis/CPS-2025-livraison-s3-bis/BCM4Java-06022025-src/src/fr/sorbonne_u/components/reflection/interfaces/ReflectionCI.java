/**
 * The interface <code>ReflectionCI</code> introduces the reflection services
 * offered by the Basic Component Model.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * The Basic Component Model reflection facility is still under construction.
 * The core idea is to expose through the interface
 * <code>IntrospectionCI</code> methods allowing to introspect components while
 * the interface <code>IntercessionCI</code> exposes the ones that allows to
 * perform intercession with components' own structure and behaviour. In a sense,
 * these interfaces mirror to a large extent the interface
 * <code>ComponentI</code> implemented by the abstract class
 * <code>AbstractComponent</code> and expose it as a component interface.
