/**
 * The interface <code>DataInboundPortI</code> represents the category of
 * ports used by components exchanging data rather than being called for
 * their services.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A data inbound port is associated with a <code>DataOfferedCI</code>
 * interface used to implement a basic interface to get data from a provider
 * component.  The primary way to get the data is the pull mode, where the
 * client component calls the provider through the <code>get()</code> method
 * which returns a piece of data.  But the port can also be used in a push
 * mode where the provider delivers the data to the client by calling a
 * <code>send</code> method with a piece of data as parameter.
 * </p>
