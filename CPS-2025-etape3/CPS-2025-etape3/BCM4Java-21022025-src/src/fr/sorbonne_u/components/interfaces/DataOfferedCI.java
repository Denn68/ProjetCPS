/**
 * The component interface <code>DataOfferedCI</code> defines a basic interface
 * for components that exchange raw data rather than calling each others
 * services.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In data exchanges, the offering component produces data, while the requiring
 * component is consuming it.  With the companion component interface
 * <code>DataRequiredCI</code>, this component interface establishes a data
 * connection in terms of basic methods called to pass the data from the
 * offering component to the requiring one.  These component interfaces provide
 * for both a push mode, where the offering component takes the initiative of
 * sending data, and a pull mode where the requiring component takes the
 * initiative of requesting data from the offering one.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Required and offered data component interfaces have three facets:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <Li>A data interface <code>DataI</code> which provides for a generic type
 *   of data expected by the offering component.</li>
 * <li>A push component interface <code>PushCI</code> which contains the
 *   signatures of the methods that are called by the offering component to
 *   send data to the requiring component.</li>
 * <li>A pull interface <code>PullCI</code> which contains the signatures
 *   of the methods that can be called by the requiring components to get
 *   data from the offering component.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The push interface of the data required interface is connected to the push
 * interface of the data offered one, while the pull interface of the data
 * offered interface is connected to the pull interface of the data required
 * one.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Even though a data offered interface do not define methods directly and
 * hence cannot be "called upon", it is convenient in the framework to see
 * it as an offered interface in the interface reflective processing. 
 * </p>
